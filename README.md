## Vagrant Dev VM

1. Copy the Vagrantfile.example and change the private IP and vm name to your
   liking
2. Copy this repo into the `.ansible` (or whatever works for you) directory of
   your Vagrant project, or add it as a submodule.
3. Run `vagrant up` the system should build itself
4. Have a beer or wine or spirit or soda or juice or water to celebrate
